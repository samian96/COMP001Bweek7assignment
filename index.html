            <h2>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h2>
            <p>One thing that helped a lot with learning our css concepts for me where the linked in videos when we had access to them. They really broke 
                down the concepts step by step to help better understand when and where to use something.

            <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
            <p>The only thing I would change is the amount of time, but even with the fast pace of this class I feel I grasped and remembered a lot of the 
                concepts that we learned.
